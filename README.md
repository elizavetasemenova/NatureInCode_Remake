# NatureInCode_Remake

In this repository I will be translating the codes from the book of Marcel Salathe 'Nature in Code', originally written in Java Script, into R and Python. The main motivation behind the book it to intorduce biologists to coding. Java Script is chosen since it runs on modern devices without additional installations, plus it is the language of the web. Anyhow, nowadays most of the Life Science analysis and modeling is done in R or Python (at least my biased perception says so). I hope that the codes in this repository will help biologists, starting with scripting, have an easy start with R and Python.
